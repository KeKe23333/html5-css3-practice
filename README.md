## 分析页面（工具）
Two things will want to seek external help for are:
1) Determining the particular colour (RGB or HEX) of various pixels (we recommend the use of [a chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/eye-dropper/hmdcmlfkchdmnmnmheododdhjedfccka/), though other alternatives may be appropriate for you)
2) Determining the size of particular elements (we recommend the use of [photopea](https://www.photopea.com/)). An example of it's usage is below:
